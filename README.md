Predicting the Weather with Artificial Neural Networks


In this project, we're going to work with a set of data that comes from the Australian government. This contains nearly nine years' worth of daily weather data
from a station in Perth.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Load a dataset from file
- __Task 2:__ Process a dataset to make it compatible with a neural network
- __Task 3:__ Split our dataset into training and testing sets
- __Task 4:__ Train a neural network and make predictions
- __Task 5:__ Optimize a neural network
